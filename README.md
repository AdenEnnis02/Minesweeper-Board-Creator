# Overview

{My project created a minesweeper board game and then takes a user input for the amount of mines that they want on the board. It then uses the createboard class to print the board with the desired amount of mines.}

{I wrote this software because I wanted to learn how to work with 2D arrays in kotlin and also learn to use loops in Kotlin so that I can learn some of the harder things there is to offer from learning a new coding language.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{I used the intelliJ IDEA CE Integrated Development Environment and it was very useful to me while coding in Kotlin. It was very effective at finding the bulit in methods I was looking for while writing the code and it was also very easy to start and new project and begin coding right away.}

{Kotlin is a coding that supports both object oriented and functional programming. Kotlin was developedto combine the strenths of many coding languages such as Java, C# and Scala. Kotlin is not unique but that is what makes it so useful and nice to work with since it is taking the good things from many different languages and aiming to create one that is better.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I need to add a function do display neighboring bombs in the minefield.
- add playable game features so that you can try to locate all the safe spaces on the board.
- Make the board creator have different options to create a board of a larger size.
